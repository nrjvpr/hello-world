# hello-world
This is the first repository that I am making. This is will aid my learning about Git Hub.
This is my first GitHub project. I want to learn how GitHUb helps in version control of projects to which multiple people contribute simultaneously. 
I also want to find people who are experts in motion control and would like to collaborate on projects with them and subsequently improve my understanding about these sorts f projects.
